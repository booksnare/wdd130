        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>In addition to playing around with code,
            I love reading, writing, and hanging out with friends.
            My newest hobby is ballroom dance.
            I just started with it a couple semesters ago, but it's been really fun! 
            I go to almost every ballroom dance or country dance event on campus, 
            so if you see me at one, come say hello!</p>
